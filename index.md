I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Global and Interdisciplinary Studies (GIS)](https://www.hosei.ac.jp/gis/?auth=9abbb458a78210eb174f4bdd385bcf54) at Hosei University, 
specializing in ethics and its history. My main areas of research are the philosophy of love, aesthetics, and the history of ethics. 
I am also currently co-authoring a book on aesthetic appreciation, , under contract with  Oxford University Press ([with Daniel Star](https://www.daniel-star.net/)).
Much of my recent work explores contemporary debates in the normative dimensions of love, a theme that intersects with my current 
project for the Cambridge Elements series on Friedrich Nietzsche.
