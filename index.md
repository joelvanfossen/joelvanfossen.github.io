I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Global and Interdisciplinary Studies (GIS)](https://www.hosei.ac.jp/gis/?auth=9abbb458a78210eb174f4bdd385bcf54) at Hosei University, specializing in normative ethics. My main areas of research are the philosophy of love, aesthetics, and the history of ethics. Much of my recent work explores contemporary debates concerning the normative dimensions of love, a topic that intersects with my current project under contract with Cambridge University Press for the Cambridge Elements Series on Friedrich Nietzsche, titled *Nietzsche on Love*. I am also currently co-authoring a book on aesthetic appreciation, titled *Appreciation*, under contract with Oxford University Press ([with Daniel Star](https://www.daniel-star.net/)). I also have an interest in 19th- and 20th-century British moral theory, especially the work of Henry Sidgwick.
