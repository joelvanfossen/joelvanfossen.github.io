I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Global and Interdisciplinary Studies (GIS)](https://www.hosei.ac.jp/gis/?auth=9abbb458a78210eb174f4bdd385bcf54) at Hosei University, specializing in normative ethics. My main areas of research are the philosophy of love, aesthetics, and the history of ethics. I am also currently co-authoring a book on aesthetic appreciation, title *Appreciation*, under contract with Oxford University Press ([with Daniel Star](https://www.daniel-star.net/)).Much of my recent work explores contemporary debates in the normative dimensions of love, a theme that intersects with my current project for Cambridge University Press's Elements Series on Friedrich Nietzsche, titled *Nietzsche on Love*.
