I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Global and Interdisciplinary Studies (GIS) at Hosei University, 
specializing in ethics and its history. My main areas of research are the philosophy of love, aesthetics, and the history of ethics. 
I am also currently co-authoring a book on aesthetic appreciation, under contract with  Oxford University Press (with Daniel Star).
Much of my recent work explores contemporary debates in the normative dimensions of love, a theme that intersects with my current 
project for the Cambridge Elements series on Friedrich Nietzsche.
